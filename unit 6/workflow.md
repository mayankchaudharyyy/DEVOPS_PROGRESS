# Jenkins Workflow

Jenkins workflow defines the sequence of steps followed to automate the software development process. It helps in implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).

A typical Jenkins workflow starts when a developer pushes code to a Git repository. Jenkins detects the change and triggers a job automatically.

### Workflow Steps

1. Developer commits and pushes code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins pulls the latest code from the repository.
3. The application is built using tools like Maven or Gradle.
4. Automated tests are executed.
5. If tests pass, a build artifact is generated.
6. Docker image can be created if required.
7. The application is deployed to the target environment.
8. Jenkins provides build status and notifications.

### Benefits of Jenkins Workflow

* Automates repetitive tasks
* Reduces manual errors
* Faster software delivery
* Easy integration with DevOps tools
* Improves code quality through continuous testing

Jenkins workflow helps teams deliver applications quickly and reliably by automating the complete build, test, and deployment process.
